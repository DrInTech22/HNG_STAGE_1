This is the repo for stage 1 task of HNG internship

## TASK
Your company has employed many new developers. As a SysOps engineer, write a bash script called create_users.sh that reads a text file containing the employeeâ€™s usernames and group names, where each line is formatted as user;groups.The script should create users and groups as specified, set up home directories with appropriate permissions and ownership, generate random passwords for the users, and log all actions to /var/log/user_management.log. 

Additionally, store the generated passwords securely in /var/secure/user_passwords.txt.Ensure error handling for scenarios like existing users and provide clear documentation and comments within the script.Also write a technical article explaining your script, linking back to HNGRequirements:

    Each User must have a personal group with the same group name as the username, this group name will not be written in the text file.
